In today's digital landscape, protecting personal and sensitive information when publishing online is crucial due to the potential risks associated with data breaches, identity theft, and privacy violations. Sharing too much information can lead to unwanted attention or exploitation, affecting both personal safety and professional reputation.For instance, using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly reviewing privacy settings can significantly enhance security. Additionally, being mindful of the content shared, such as avoiding personal identifiers or sensitive details, is essential.Balancing openness and collaboration in online spaces, particularly in coding projects, requires a thoughtful strategy.

In the last semester, I've enjoy the time we got to code with the drones and cars. I which that we could improve on is that we can be more careful of the drones because we weren't able to use them anymore because of that. I'll like to start of the semester by learning more about codes and doing more activites and have group projects for fun. I'm not really intrested in certifications right now.
